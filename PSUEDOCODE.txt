STEPS-
1) Define all parameters and input files to execute run_minseqfind_1.
2) run_minseqfind_1 executes minseqfind_1 function for the given parameters and files.
3) minseqfind_1 function first creates a library model from the given library, model order and other parameters.
4) Next sample file data is processed through init_data_process_v1 function.
5) The data is then processed by counting k-mers or MinSeqs using get_counts_bgs_ng_v1 and get_counts_bgs_gp_v1. These functions also calculate the estimated library counts for these sequences using library model.
6) Next the MinSeq counts are divided by the estimated counts in library and after some thresholding PWMs are obtained using get_pwm_from_minseq_v1 function.

Further details are there in comments of the code itself.
